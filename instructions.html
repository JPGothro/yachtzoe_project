          Welcome to <span class="branding">YachtZoe!</span>, the original dice game. This game is in no way affiliated with its popular knockoff "Yahtzee". To win, you must roll five dice in various combinations to get the highest score possible.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Each player may roll the dice up to 3 times per turn to get the highest scoring combination. The player must select zero or one of the 13 combination categories to complete their turn.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Additionally, players may choose to hold certain dice during their turn and roll the remaining until their turn is complete.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The game ends when all players have completed their score table.
        </p>
